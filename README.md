# IOM Website Clone

This project consists of a **replica** of the website of the **International Organization for Migration (IOM Portugal)**, available at [https://portugal.iom.int/](https://portugal.iom.int/).

## Project Overview
The goal of this assignment was to replicate the visual design and implement interactive functionalities inspired by the IOM Portugal website, using only **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**.  

This project served as an introduction to front-end web development allowing to gain hands-on experience with the core web technologies that form the foundation of modern websites.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – Structure and semantic layout  
- **SCSS (SASS)** – Advanced styling with variables, nesting, and partials (compiled to CSS3)  
- **JavaScript** – Dynamic functionality and DOM manipulation  

## Main Features
- Responsive design adaptable to different screen sizes
- Simulation of **donations** (one-time or recurring)  
- Calculation of:
  - Number of **meals** provided with each donation  
  - Number of **people** that can be fed daily  
  - **Duration** a donation can support a person (for monthly donations)
- Validation and collection of donor information (individuals or companies)

## Restrictions
This project was developed entirely from scratch, **without using any external frameworks or libraries** (e.g., Bootstrap, jQuery, Foundation, etc.) as required by the assignment.

## Live Demo
You can view the website here:
